ArduinoToPubNub
===============

The Internet of Things aims to connect physical and virtual objects through the cloud and network communications. It allows devices to communicate with each other, access information on the Internet, store and retrieve data, and interact with users, creating smart, pervasive and always-connected environments.The Arduino is an incredibly flexible micro-controller that can not only be used to control devices, but can also be used to read data from sensors.

Here I demonstrate how to connect the Arduino to PubNub and communicate with a million other devices in just two steps.

Run the arduino.ino on the Arduino IDE. Make sure to inlcude PubNub.h, PubNub.cpp (available at https://github.com/pubnub/c/tree/master/libpubnub-cpp) and iotconnector.h in the same folder as arduino.ino in the Arduino IDE. 

iotconnector.h is the header file with the class definitions.
